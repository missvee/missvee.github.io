		<p>So after some thinking, I decided to narrow down my options to just material swap. Knowing how much the facebook group, MICA free & for sale is growing (it's now up to 1,260 members!) </p>
		
		<p>After finding some sell/buying apps, it gave me a better idea how to organize the functions for my own designed app. I would prefer the app to be focused on giving away things and taking things. </p>
		
		<p>I want MICA students to be able to imagine a world without money. Even if people are giving things away, they should not expect something in return. It'd be nice to go back to the basics of the goodness in humanity. </p>
